# Contributing to Livestreamer Twitch GUI

Want to get involved? Thanks! There are plenty of ways to help!


## Reporting issues

A bug is a *demonstrable problem* that is caused by the code in the repository. Good bug reports are extremely helpful - thank you!

Please read the following guidelines before you [report an issue][issues]:

1. **Use the GitHub issue search** — check if the issue has already been reported. If it has been, please comment on the existing issue.

2. **Check if the issue has been fixed** — the latest `master` or development branch may already contain a fix.

3. **Isolate the demonstrable problem** — make sure that the code in the project's repository is *definitely* responsible for the issue.

Please try to be as detailed as possible in your report too. What is your environment? What steps will reproduce the issue? What would you expect to be the outcome? All these details will help people to assess and fix any potential bugs.

Using the [ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md] [issue template] when reporting an issue is appreciated.


## Feature requests

Feature requests are welcome. But take a moment to find out whether your idea fits with the scope and aims of the project. It's up to *you* to make a strong case to convince the project's developers of the merits of this feature. Please provide as much detail and context as possible.


## Developing and building
Livestreamer Twitch GUI is based on [NW.js (formerly Node-Webkit)][NW.js]. This means, that if you want to debug or contribute to this program, NW.js has to be installed on your machine - using a browser does not work. There are grunt tasks available that will download and start NW.js for you (see below). Also please ensure that either [io.js][io.js] or [Node.js][Node.js] and also [npm][npm] are installed, so all dependencies can be installed as well and the application can be built and compiled.  
If you want to know more about NW.js apps in general, head over to the [NW.js wiki page][NW.js-wiki].

Run these commands to get started:

```bash
# globally install grunt-cli and bower - may require administrator privileges
npm install -g grunt-cli bower
# locally install all npm and bower dependencies
npm install
```

If you just want to build and compile the application, do this:

```bash
# build and compile - executable will be created inside the build/releases folder
grunt release
```

To get a list of all available grunt tasks, run `grunt --help`, or just take a look at the files in `build/tasks/{config,custom}`. 

While developing, you can choose between two methods:

1. **Run the "precompiled" application**  
   Simply run `grunt`. This will start the `dev` grunt task, which will then begin building the application (with enabled debug flags) into the `build/tmp` folder. This task will also start a couple of file watchers which rebuild the application as soon as some changes are being made inside the `src` folder. NW.js will automatically be started (and downloaded, if it hasn't been installed yet).

2. **Run the application from source**  
   Another way of running the application is by starting it directly from the `src` folder (`grunt run:src`). Before you can do this though, you first need to run the `grunt metadata less:source` tasks once. If you're working on the stylesheets, then you should also start the watcher task `grunt watch:lesssource`, which will automatically recompile the stylesheets after each change.

The easiest way of debugging a NW.js application is by running `nw` with the `--remote-debugging-port=8888` parameter (the grunt `run` task already does this). Then you can comfortably access the developer console in your local browser at `http://localhost:8888/`. I recommend adding an alias for the `nw` + parameter command.
If you're running the application from source or the compiled debug version, you're able to access NW.js' internal developer tools by clicking on the embedded button inside the titlebar.
There also exist several IDEs with NW.js debugging support, too.


## Pull requests

Good pull requests - patches, improvements, new features - are a fantastic help. They should remain focused in scope and avoid containing unrelated commits.

**Please ask first** before embarking on any significant pull request (e.g. implementing features, refactoring code, porting to a different language), otherwise you risk spending a lot of time working on something that the project's developers might not want to merge into the project.

Please adhere to the coding conventions used throughout a project (indentation, white space, accurate comments, etc.) and any other requirements (such as test coverage).

Adhering to the following process is the best way to get your work included in the project:

1. [Fork][howto-fork] the project, clone your fork, and configure the remotes:
   ```bash
   # Clone your fork of the repo into the current directory
   git clone git@github.com:<YOUR-USERNAME>/livestreamer-twitch-gui.git
   # Navigate to the newly cloned directory
   cd livestreamer-twitch-gui
   # Assign the original repo to a remote called "upstream"
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/bastimeyer/livestreamer-twitch-gui.git
   ```

2. If you cloned a while ago, get the latest changes from upstream
   ```bash
   git checkout master
   git pull upstream master
   ```

3. Create a new topic branch (off the main project branch) to contain your feature, change, or fix:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b <TOPIC-BRANCH-NAME>
   ```

4. Commit your changes in logical chunks. Please adhere to these [git commit message guidelines][howto-format-commits] or your code is unlikely be merged into the project. Use git's [interactive rebase][howto-rebase] feature to tidy up your commits before making them public.

5. Locally merge (or rebase) the upstream branch into your topic branch:
   ```bash
   git pull [--rebase] upstream master
   ```

6. Push your topic branch up to your fork:
   ```bash
   git push origin <TOPIC-BRANCH-NAME>
   ```

7. [Open a Pull Request][howto-open-pull-requests] with a clear title and description.

**IMPORTANT**: By submitting a patch, you agree to allow the project owners to license your work 
under the terms of the [MIT License][license].
