## [v0.2.3](https://github.com/bastimeyer/livestreamer-twitch-gui/releases/tag/v0.2.3) (2014-02-12)

[Changelog](https://github.com/bastimeyer/livestreamer-twitch-gui/compare/v0.2.2...v0.2.3)

## [v0.2.1](https://github.com/bastimeyer/livestreamer-twitch-gui/releases/tag/v0.2.1) (2013-12-30)

Just a patch release, no new features.

[Changelog](https://github.com/bastimeyer/livestreamer-twitch-gui/compare/v0.2.0...v0.2.1)


## [v0.2.0](https://github.com/bastimeyer/livestreamer-twitch-gui/releases/tag/v0.2.0) (2013-12-21)

In this release I've added the settings menu so you can now set the path to where you've installed livestreamer to. You can also change the default stream quality.
There is currently no validation of the user input and some more fields for customizing the videoplayer are disabled for now. I'm planning to add those things (and also the ability to choose the quality by each stream individually) in the next releases, but thats it for now.

[Changelog](https://github.com/bastimeyer/livestreamer-twitch-gui/compare/v0.1.0...v0.2.0)


## [v0.1.0](https://github.com/bastimeyer/livestreamer-twitch-gui/releases/tag/v0.1.0) (2013-12-13)

There is not much to see, just some core functionality and some design ideas.

The only thing you can do right now is browsing the top games, top channels by game and all top channels. A click on a channel will then start a new livestreamer process with the stream quality preset "best". Please make sure that livestreamer is defined in your PATH-variable. There will be no output of this child process, so please be patient and wait for your videoplayer to start.
